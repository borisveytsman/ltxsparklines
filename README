Sparklines are small plots (about one line of text high),
made popular by Edward Tufte.  This package is the interface from R
to the LaTeX package sparklines by Andreas Loeffer and Dan Luecking
(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/sparklines).  It can work with Sweave or
knitr or other engines that produce TeX.  The package can be used to
plot vectors, matrices, data frames, time series (in ts or zoo format).

Do not forget to add \usepackage{sparklines} to the preamble of your
TeX document.
