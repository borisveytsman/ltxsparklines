Sparklines are small plots (about one line of text high),
made popular by Edward Tufte.  This package is the interface from R
to the LaTeX package sparklines by Andreas Loeffer and Dan Luecking
(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/sparklines).  It can work with Sweave or
knitr or other engines that produce TeX.  The package can be used to
plot vectors, matrices, data frames, time series (in ts or zoo format).
