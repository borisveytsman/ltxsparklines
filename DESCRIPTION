Description: Sparklines are small plots (about one line of text high),
  made popular by Edward Tufte.  This package is the interface from R
  to the LaTeX package sparklines by Andreas Loeffer and Dan Luecking
  (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/sparklines).  It can work with Sweave or
  knitr or other engines that produce TeX.  The package can be used to
  plot vectors, matrices, data frames, time series (in ts or zoo format).
